  # The contact form module sticks the answers to its CAPTCHA in this
  # directory, and then hopes/wishes/prays that its apache-2.2.x
  # .htaccess file will prevent anonymous web access to the answers
  # (which have predictable names!). We need to wipe out the generated
  # .htaccess because it kills apache-2.4, but we don't want people to
  # be able to read the CAPTCHA answers.
