    # The "PT" flag in the following rules works around some
    # retardation in the Drupal "redirect" module, which expects the
    # PHP $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'] variable to be set to "/index.php",
    # and which refuses to redirect otherwise. Our script name would
    # be empty if we didn't set the "PT" flag below; that happens by
    # default when your rewrite rules are in an .htaccess file, and is
    # probably why those geniuses think their test is reasonable.
