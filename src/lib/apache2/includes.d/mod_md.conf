  # Our ServerNames macro takes $host.$domain and sets up a server
  # name of $host.domain and an alias of $domain.  That means that
  # www.example.com and mail.example.com will both get ServerAliases
  # for example.com. This Doesn't seem to bother Apache itself too
  # much (one of them just takes preference, and we put the vhosts in
  # the order that makes it do the right thing), but I'm not sure what
  # mod_md will think of it. And since we mostly use long lists of
  # ServerAliases for "junk" redirect names that don't need SSLs, it
  # shouldn't be a problem to just list each set of names manually.
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #   MDomain example.com www.example.com
  #   MDomain mail.example.com
